To run the code:

Open the directory with your IDE of choice, using Java 20, or directly from the terminal

Run Search.java to run the recursion algorithm

	Inside Search.java, at the beginning of the file you can tweak the horizontalGridSize and verticalGridSize values to
	use a different sized grid, with a different number of pentominos.

Run BasicSearch.java to run the bruteforce/random, basic algorithm
	
	Inside Search.java, at the beginning of the file you can tweak the horizontalGridSize and verticalGridSize values to
	use a different sized grid, with a different number of pentominos. You can also tweak the input array and the 
	pentCount variable, which is having issues in the recursion algorithm.

If you encounter any issues, make sure your IDE or terminal has access to the whole directory, as the Search.java file
references other files and folders within it.
